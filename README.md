# Sales Data Analysis Dashboard

I built a sales dashboard from scratch to practice my data skills. I used Python to create a realistic sales dataset and then built an interactive dashboard in Power BI to analyze it.

## What's in this project:

*   A Python script that automatically generates fake sales data for a year.
*   An Excel file with that data, split into different tables (like Products, Sales, etc.).
*   A Power BI file that connects to the Excel file to create charts and graphs.

## How to use these files:

1.  The `data_gashboard.xlsx` file is the main data. You can open it in Excel to see what the data looks like.
2.  The `data_creator.py` file is the Python script that made the data. If you want to create new data, just run this script (you'll need the pandas library installed).
3.  The `sales_dashboard.pbix` is the Power BI dashboard. You need Power BI Desktop installed on your computer to open it.

## Skills I used:

*   Python (Pandas)
*   Data Modeling
*   Power BI
*   DAX (for calculations in Power BI)
